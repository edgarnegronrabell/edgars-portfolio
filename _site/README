This is my first project. 
It's a web portfolio for all of the skills that I have. 
Although I consider that speaking 3 to 4 languages are also valuable
skills to have, my main focus will be my film and editing skills,
(as well as my Television experience), my graphic design skills and 
my programming skills, which so far is just this site. 

Main image: My graduation photo is iconic to me, I think that the black 
and white is nice, and I decided to turn the background into black, so
there is somewhat of a transition from my toga to the rest of the page.

Text over the image: I'm currently working on this, I want to give it 
an effect where the text, gets distorted with the image under it, 
without sacrificing readability. I'm not sure what the effect is called
but it's definitely some kind of distort effect.


Social media footer: I only have two relevant profesional URL's that I can
put here.

Other things: I'm still working on all three of my portfolios, so far
I'm just making this so that I can practice my HTML, CSS and eventually, JavaScript, 
skills. I've started adding some design's I've made. 

That's it for now, if anybody comes across this and would like to make any suggestions as well,
I'm all ears. 


March 30, 2019: UPDATE

I added some of the languages that I'm going to be focusing on learning
in the coming months to the programming section.
I'm currently learning CSS Grid to add images in an interesting way
but am having a hard time understanding it in practice.
I have a couple of issues throughout the project, I'll leave
some comments, in case anyone comes across the project and 
would like to help out.
